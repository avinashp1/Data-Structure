Definition of Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a non-linear data structure where each node has at most two children.

Advantages:
- Hierarchical structure.
- Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion (in balanced trees).

Disadvantages:
- Can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance.
- More complex to implement than linear structures.

**Real-life examples:**
- Storing hierarchical data like file systems or organization charts.
- Implementing binary search trees for fast lookup.
- Expression trees in compilers and calculators.
