Definition of Graph:
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.

Advantages:
- Models complex relationships.
- Useful for networks, social graphs, etc.

Disadvantages:
- Can be complex to implement and traverse.
- May require more memory for adjacency structures.

**Real-life examples:**
- Representing social networks (users and friendships).
- Mapping routes in GPS navigation systems.
- Modeling the internet (web pages and links).
