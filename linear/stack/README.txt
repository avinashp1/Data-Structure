Definition of Stack:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

Advantages:
- Simple to implement.
- Useful for undo operations, parsing, and backtracking.

Disadvantages:
- Limited access (only top element accessible).
- Not suitable for searching or random access.

**Real-life examples:**
- Undo/redo functionality in applications.
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing in compilers.
- Navigating browser history (back/forward)
