Definition of LinkedList:
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing efficient insertions and deletions.

Advantages:
- Dynamic size.
- Efficient insertions/deletions.

Disadvantages:
- No direct access by index (O(n) search).
- Extra memory for pointers.

**Real-life examples:**
- Implementing a playlist where songs can be added/removed anywhere.
- Managing free memory blocks in operating systems (memory management).
- Navigating through images in a photo viewer (next/previous).
